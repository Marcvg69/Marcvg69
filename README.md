# links
The "Title" is optional
This is [an example](http://example.com "Title") inline link.

## Links to Headings
Assuming you have a heading called `# My First Heading` then link is the case-insensitive string with spaces replaced by dashes:
[Visible Link Text](#my-first-heading "Hover-text link title")

# image
![Alt Text](/path/to/file.png)

Left-aligned Stuff | Right-aligned Stuff | Center-aligned Stuff
| :--- | ---: | :---:
Some left stuff   | Some right stuff  | Some center stuff 
Some left stuff   | Some right stuff  | Some center stuff 

## Special Characters in Tables

Some stuff   | things about stuff
Other Stuff  |  A \| B
